THE PREFACE
The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and conceal the
artist is art's aim. The critic is he who can translate into another manner
or a new material his impression of beautiful things.
The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.
Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without
being charming. This is a fault.
Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated.
For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean
only beauty.
There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well
written, or badly written. That is all.
The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his
own face in a glass.
The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban not
seeing his own face in a glass. The moral life of man forms part of the
subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in the perfect
use of an imperfect medium. No artist desires to prove anything. Even
things that are true can be proved. No artist has ethical sympathies. An
ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style. No
artist is ever morbid. The artist can express everything. Thought and
language are to the artist instruments of an art. Vice and virtue are to the
artist materials for an art. From the point of view of form, the type of all
the arts is the art of the musician. From the point of view of feeling, the
actor's craft is the type. All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who
go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol
do so at their peril. It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors.
Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new,
complex, and vital. When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with
himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he
does not admire it. The only excuse for making a useless thing is that
one admires it intensely.
All art is quite useless.

CHAPTER 1
The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light
summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through
the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume
of the pink-flowering thorn.
From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was
lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry
Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honeycoloured
blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed
hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now
and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long
tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window,
producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of
those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of
an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness
and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way
through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence
round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make
the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London was like the
bourdon note of a distant organ.
