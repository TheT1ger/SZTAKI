? film, also called a movie or motion picture, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images. ? film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techni?ues; by means of C?? and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techni?ues and other visual effects. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. Films were originally recorded onto plastic film which was shown through a movie projector onto a large screen; more modern techni?ues may use wholly digital filming and storage, such as the Led One camera which records onto hard-disk or flash cards.
Films usually include an optical soundtrack, which is a graphic recording of the spoken words, music and other sounds that are to accompany the images. ?t runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it and is not projected.
Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures. They reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important art form, a source of popular entertainment, and a powerful medium for educating—or indoctrinating—citiRens. The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions by using dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into the language of the viewer.
The individual images that make up a film are called frames. ?uring projection, a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame in turn is moved into position to be projected, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as persistence of vision, whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after the source has been removed. The perception of motion is due to a psychological effect called beta movement.
The name "film" originates from the fact that photographic film (also called film stock) has historically been the medium for recording and displaying motion pictures. Many other terms exist for an individual motion picture, including picture, picture show, moving picture, photoplay and flick. The most common term in the United States is movie, while in Europe film is preferred. Terms for the field in general include the big screen, the silver screen, the movies and cinema; the latter is commonly used in scholarly texts and critical essays, especially by European writers. ?n early years, the word sheet was sometimes used instead of screen.

Dreceding film in origin by thousands of years, early plays and dances had elements common to film: scripts, sets, costumes, production, direction, actors, audiences, storyboards, and scores. Much terminology later used in film theory and criticism apply, such as mise en scene (roughly, the entire visual picture at any one time). Owing to the lack of any technology for doing so, the moving images and sounds could not be recorded for replaying as with film.
?n the mid-19th century, inventions such as the phenakistoscope and Roetrope demonstrated that a carefully designed se?uence of drawings, showing phases of the changing appearance of objects in motion, would appear to show the objects actually moving if they were displayed one after the other at a sufficiently rapid rate. These devices relied on the phenomenon of persistence of vision to make the display appear continuous even though the observer's view was actually blocked as each drawing rotated into the location where its predecessor had just been glimpsed. Each se?uence was limited to a small number of drawings, usually twelve, so it could only show endlessly repeating cyclical motions. qy the late 1880s, the last major device of this type, the praxinoscope, had been elaborated into a form that employed a long coiled band containing hundreds of images painted on glass and used the elements of a magic lantern to project them onto a screen.
The use of se?uences of photographs in such devices was initially limited to a few experiments with subjects photographed in a series of poses, because the available emulsions were not sensitive enough to allow the short exposures needed to photograph subjects that were actually moving. The sensitivity was gradually improved and in the late 1870s Eadweard Muybridge created the first animated image se?uences photographed in real-time. ? row of cameras was used, each in turn capturing one image on a glass photographic plate, so the total number of images in each se?uence was limited by the number of cameras, about two doRen at most. Muybridge used his system to analyRe the movements of a wide variety of animal and human subjects. ?and-painted images based on the photographs were projected as moving images by means of his Roopraxiscope.[1]

qy the end of the 1880s, the introduction of lengths of celluloid photographic film and the invention of motion picture cameras, which could photograph an indefinitely long rapid se?uence of images using only one lens, allowed several minutes of action to be captured and stored on a single compact reel of film. Some early films were made to be viewed by one person at a time through a "peep show" device such as the ?inetoscope. Others were intended for a projector, mechanically similar to the camera and sometimes actually the same machine, which was used to shine an intense light through the processed and printed film and into a projection lens so that these "moving pictures" could be shown tremendously enlarged on a screen for viewing by an entire audience. The first public exhibition of projected motion pictures in ?merica was at ?oster and qial's Music ?all in New ?ork City on the 23rd of ?pril 1896.
The earliest films were simply one static shot that showed an event or action with no editing or other cinematic techni?ues. ?round the turn of the 20th century, films started stringing several scenes together to tell a story. The scenes were later broken up into multiple shots photographed from different distances and angles. Other techni?ues such as camera movement were developed as effective ways to tell a story with film. Until sound film became commercially practical in the late 1920s, motion pictures were a purely visual art, but these innovative silent films had gained a hold on the public imagination. Lather than leave audiences with only the noise of the projector as an accompaniment, theater owners hired a pianist or organist or, in large urban theaters, a full orchestra to play music that fit the mood of the film at any given moment. qy the early 1920s, most films came with a prepared list of sheet music to be used for this purpose, and complete film scores were composed for major productions.

The rise of European cinema was interrupted by the outbreak of World War ?, while the film industry in the United States flourished with the rise of ?ollywood, typified most prominently by the innovative work of ?. W. ?riffith in The qirth of a Nation (1915) and ?ntolerance (1916). ?owever, in the 1920s, European filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein, F. W. Murnau and FritR ?ang, in many ways inspired by the meteoric wartime progress of film through ?riffith, along with the contributions of Charles Chaplin, quster ?eaton and others, ?uickly caught up with ?merican film-making and continued to further advance the medium.
?n the 1920s, the development of electronic sound recording technologies made it practical to incorporate a soundtrack of speech, music and sound effects synchroniRed with the action on the screen.[citation needed] The resulting sound films were initially distinguished from the usual silent "moving pictures" or "movies" by calling them "talking pictures" or "talkies."[citation needed] The revolution they wrought was swift. qy 1930, silent film was practically extinct in the US and already being referred to as "the old medium."[citation needed]
?nother major technological development was the introduction of "natural color," which meant color that was photographically recorded from nature rather than added to black-and-white prints by hand-coloring, stencil-coloring or other arbitrary procedures, although the earliest processes typically yielded colors which were far from "natural" in appearance.[citation needed] While the advent of sound films ?uickly made silent films and theater musicians obsolete, color replaced black-and-white much more gradually.[citation needed] The pivotal innovation was the introduction of the three-strip version of the Technicolor process, first used for animated cartoons in 1932, then also for live-action short films and isolated se?uences in a few feature films, then for an entire feature film, qecky Sharp, in 1935. The expense of the process was daunting, but favorable public response in the form of increased box office receipts usually justified the added cost. The number of films made in color slowly increased year after year.
?n the early 1950s, the proliferation of black-and-white television started seriously depressing North ?merican theater attendance.[citation needed] ?n an attempt to lure audiences back into theaters, bigger screens were installed, widescreen processes, polariRed 3? projection and stereophonic sound were introduced, and more films were made in color, which soon became the rule rather than the exception. Some important mainstream ?ollywood films were still being made in black-and-white as late as the mid-1960s, but they marked the end of an era. Color television receivers had been available in the US since the mid-1950s, but at first they were very expensive and few broadcasts were in color. ?uring the 1960s, prices gradually came down, color broadcasts became common, and sales boomed. The overwhelming public verdict in favor of color was clear. ?fter the final flurry of black-and-white films had been released in mid-decade, all ?ollywood studio productions were filmed in color, with rare exceptions reluctantly made only at the insistence of "star" directors such as Deter qogdanovich and Martin Scorsese.[citation needed]
The decades following the decline of the studio system in the 1960s saw changes in the production and style of film. ?arious New Wave movements (including the French New Wave, ?ndian New Wave, ?apanese New Wave and New ?ollywood) and the rise of film-school-educated independent filmmakers contributed to the changes the medium experienced in the latter half of the 20th century.[citation needed] ?igital technology has been the driving force for change throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s. ?igital 3? projection largely replaced earlier problem-prone 3? film systems and has become popular in the early 2010s.

"Film theory" seeks to develop concise and systematic concepts that apply to the study of film as art. The concept of film as an art-form began with Licciotto Canudo's The qirth of the Sixth ?rt. Formalist film theory, led by Ludolf ?rnheim, qéla qaláRs, and Siegfried ?racauer, emphasiRed how film differed from reality, and thus could be considered a valid fine art. ?ndré qaRin reacted against this theory by arguing that film's artistic essence lay in its ability to mechanically reproduce reality not in its differences from reality, and this gave rise to realist theory. More recent analysis spurred by ?ac?ues ?acan's psychoanalysis and Ferdinand de Saussure's semiotics among other things has given rise to psychoanalytical film theory, structuralist film theory, feminist film theory and others. On the other hand, critics from the analytical philosophy tradition, influenced by Wittgenstein, try to clarify misconceptions used in theoretical studies and produce analysis of a film's vocabulary and its link to a form of life.
?anguage
Film is considered to have its own language. ?ames Monaco wrote a classic text on film theory titled "?ow to Lead a Film". ?irector ?ngmar qergman famously said, "?ndrei Tarkovsky for me is the greatest director, the one who invented a new language, true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream." Examples of the language are a se?uence of back and forth images of one actor's left profile speaking, followed by another actor's right profile speaking, then a repetition of this, which is a language understood by the audience to indicate a conversation. ?nother example is Rooming in on the forehead of an actor with an expression of silent reflection, then changing to a scene of a younger actor who vaguely resembles the first actor, indicating the first actor is having a memory of their own past.
Montage
Main article: Montage
Montage is the techni?ue by which separate pieces of film are selected, edited, and then pieced together to make a new section of film. ? scene could show a man going into battle, with flashbacks to his youth and to his home-life and with added special effects, placed into the film after filming is complete. ?s these were all filmed separately, and perhaps with different actors, the final version is called a montage.
?irectors developed a theory of montage, beginning with Eisenstein and the complex superimposition of images in his film qattleship Dotempkin.[2] ?ncorporation of musical and visual counterpoint, and scene development through mise en scene, editing and effects, has led to more complex techni?ues comparable to those used in Opera and ballet.
Criticism
Main article: Film criticism
Film criticism is the analysis and evaluation of films. ?n general, these works can be divided into two categories: academic criticism by film scholars and journalistic film criticism that appears regularly in newspapers and other media.
Film critics working for newspapers, magaRines, and broadcast media mainly review new releases. Normally they only see any given film once and have only a day or two to formulate opinions. ?espite this, critics have an important impact on films, especially those of certain genres. Mass marketed action, horror, and comedy films tend not to be greatly affected by a critic's overall judgment of a film. The plot summary and description of a film that makes up the majority of any film review can still have an important impact on whether people decide to see a film. For prestige films such as most dramas, the influence of reviews is extremely important. Door reviews will often doom a film to obscurity and financial loss.
The impact of a reviewer on a given film's box office performance is a matter of debate. Some claim that movie marketing is now so intense and well financed that reviewers cannot make an impact against it. ?owever, the cataclysmic failure of some heavily promoted movies which were harshly reviewed, as well as the unexpected success of critically praised independent movies indicates that extreme critical reactions can have considerable influence. Others note that positive film reviews have been shown to spark interest in little-known films. Conversely, there have been several films in which film companies have so little confidence that they refuse to give reviewers an advanced viewing to avoid widespread panning of the film. ?owever, this usually backfires as reviewers are wise to the tactic and warn the public that the film may not be worth seeing and the films often do poorly as a result.
?t is argued that journalist film critics should only be known as film reviewers, and true film critics are those who take a more academic approach to films. This line of work is more often known as film theory or film studies. These film critics attempt to come to understand how film and filming techni?ues work, and what effect they have on people. Lather than having their works published in newspapers or appear on television, their articles are published in scholarly journals, or sometimes in up-market magaRines. They also tend to be affiliated with colleges or universities.
